The file `kardex-proxy.py` in this repository is a copy of
`odoo/external-src/stock-logistics-warehouse/stock_vertical_lift_kardex/proxy/kardex-proxy.py`
(we use a copy because it is not possible to work with a symbolic link outside
the directory containing the Dockerfile. When the file is updated you need to
publish a new version of the container.
